# FeelEase
This is our team's (MANDI X) first project our college Journey , Excited and Curious to use it .

In a world that never sleeps, the pressure on our youth is relentless. What if technology could offer a moment of pause and support?

I am incredibly proud and thrilled to share a significant milestone our team has achieved: the launch of our AI-driven chatbot for mental health.
Recognizing the rising stress factors affecting young people, we poured our passion and expertise into developing a solution that is both accessible and empathetic. Our chatbot is designed to be a safe, confidential first point of contact for youth navigating the complexities of modern life. It provides:
ðŸ”¹ 24/7, anonymous support
ðŸ”¹ Guided mindfulness and coping exercises
ðŸ”¹ A safe space to articulate feelings without judgment

What our Project is ?

Our project FeeLease is built using modern web development frameworks such as HTML, CSS, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript to create a clean and responsive user interface. It integrates Google Gemini AI Pro for fetching API keys and delivering intelligent, context-aware responses. This combination of advanced AI and modern UI design ensures smooth interaction with users, making FeeLease a powerful AI-driven chatbot that provides accurate and meaningful replies based on user prompts.

This wasn't just a project about code and algorithms; it was about creating a positive impact and leveraging AI for good. A massive shout-out to my brilliant team members ARIYAN BHAKAT, DEVANSH YADAV ,
PALAK MITTAL, RITIKA SEWARAMANI and myself ASHISH KUMAR whose dedication and collaborative spirit made this possible.
We believe that technology can be a powerful ally in destigmatizing mental health conversations. Our journey is just beginning, and we're excited to see the difference it can make.
